## Why is this subject?

  - A controversial topic (Gun Violence)

  - Provide an edge of the problems, a tip of the iceberg.
  
  - Raise your insights about the problems, then you can draw conclusions for yourself in order to protect you and your family.
  
  - Recognize the primitive signs, not to live in skeptics but to enhance your awareness.

## DATA
  
  ``` Words on my data set ```
  > Words on my data set 

- **164 observations and 26 variables** from 1960 to 2023.
  (It was 143 observations and 25 variables originally from 1982 to 2022)

- My data set's limitation:

  + Two data sets with two completely different structures.
  + Various manually plug-in data (15%)

  # **Mother Jones**
  <https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/>

- The data set's authors are MARK FOLLMAN, GAVIN ARONSEN, and DEANNA PAN.

- The time span they collect is from 1982 to present, which included `originally 143 observations and 25 variables`. This is my work's mainframe.

  # **The Violence Project**
  <https://www.theviolenceproject.org/>

- No specific author's names.

- The time span is from 1960 to 2022. This is the supplemental data for my main data frame.

  


## DATA(cont.)

```{r Input Source, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
my_data <- read.csv('Mother Jones - Mass Shootings Database, 1982 - 2023 - Sheet1.csv', na.strings = "-")
my_data2 <- read.csv('Violence Project Mass Shooter Database - Version 6.1 - Full Database.csv', na.strings = "-")
```

- both in form of `csv file`.

  > first set: familiar with what we have been learned so far.

  > second set: highly complicated

- Missing data:

  > NA(Not Available) - Missing value
  
  > Unclear - The information has not been revealed by the authority.
  
  > TBD(To Be Determined) - The information has not been confirm yet.

## What's The Mass Shooting?
<br>
> The FBI defines a "mass shooting" as any incidents in which at least four people are murdered with a gun.

### What questions should be raised?

> Will the time frame would say anything about the incidents `in general`?

> Would the `age, race, and gender` give any insights about the shooter's profile?

> What would stand out if we cross `the shooter with prior mental health issues` out of the equation?

> Where are the `locations` that the incidents likely take place?

> What `types of weapons` the assaiants likely use? 

> What conclusion about the `age of shooter`, `race` and `prior mental health issues` could we draw?

> What is interesting about the connection between `age of the shooter` over `year`?

> Will `gender` play any roles in corresponding to `age of the shooter`?

> How have the incidents distributed `across the America`?


## A First Glance about the Incidents over Years


```{r General, echo=FALSE}
hp <- my_data %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(Cases = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(.)) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = 100 * Cases/sum(Cases))

```

```{r General Plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

hp %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y = Cases)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = 'identity', fill = 'yellow') +
  theme_dark() +
  labs(title = 'Incidents over Time',
       x = 'Year',
       y = 'Cases')

```

## Data Summary

```{r Data Summary, echo=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  select(age_of_shooter, fatalities, injured, total_victims) %>% 
  summary()
```

## 

**Las Vegas Strip Massacre**: 604 victims 

```{r Vegas 604, echo=FALSE}
my_data %>%
  filter(total_victims == 604) %>% 
  select(Case = case,Fatality =  fatalities, Injured = injured, Victims = total_victims, City = city, State = state, Date = date, Age = age_of_shooter, Race = race, Gender = gender, Weapons = weapon_type)
```


**LA Dance Studio Mass Shooting**: Oldest age for a mass shooter

**West Middle School Killings**: Youngest age 


```{r Age Outlier, echo=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  filter(age_of_shooter == '11' | age_of_shooter == '72') %>% 
  select(Case = case, Age = age_of_shooter, Fatality =  fatalities, Injured = injured, Victims = total_victims, City = city, State = state, Date = date, Race = race, Gender = gender, Weapons = weapon_type)
```

- Outliers for each of the variables that they represent.


## Who are they?

### The Whole Picture

```{r Race, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
my_data %>%
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(Total = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>% 
  mutate(Ratio = 100 * Total/sum(Total))
```

### Before 2002

```{r echo=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  filter(year < 2002) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>% 
  mutate(Ratio = 100 * Count/sum(Count))
```
### After 2002

```{r echo=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  filter(year > 2002) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>% 
  mutate(Ratio = 100 * Count/sum(Count))
```


##

```{r Age vs Race Plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = age_of_shooter)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color = 'navy') +
  labs(title = 'Age and Race Relationships',
       x = 'Race', 
       y = 'Age')
           
```


The Average Age of the Shooters among Races

|Race       |Average Age of the Shooters  |
|:----------|-----------------------------|
|White      |~ 28-29 years old            |
|Latino     |~ 32-33 years old            |
|Black      |~ 38-39 years old            |
|Asian      |~ 41 years old               |
|Native Am. |~ 18 years old               |  




## Where Do The Mass Shootings Likely Occur?


```{r Location Occurs, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = 100 * Count/sum(Count)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(location, Count), y = Count )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'Orange') + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'MOst Frequent Places',
          x = 'Location',
          y = 'Frequency')
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = 100 * Count/sum(Count))
```

##

|Location             |Frequency  |
|:--------------------|-----------|
|Workplace            |~ 34%      |
|School               |~ 16%      |
|Bar/Club/Rest.       |~ 11%      |
|Retail               |~ 10%      |
|Other                |~ 9%       |
|Religious Place      |~ 6%       |


Limited information about the observations in `location` variable in the raw data. 

  - Most of the Nightlife observations like Bar/Club/Restaurants was classified as `Other`, which make the original data had a big chunk of number in 'Other' category.


## What Weapons Were Likely Used by The Assailants? 


```{r Firearms, echo=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  group_by(weapon_type) %>% 
  summarize(Count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = 100 * Count/sum(Count)) %>%
  select(weapon_type, Percentage, everything()) %>% 
  filter(Count > 1)
```

|Firearm                    |Percent of Carrying          |
|:--------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Semi-Auto Handgun          |~ 41%                        |
|Semi-Auto Rifle            |~ 20%                        |
|Handgun(Old Versions)      |~ 6.7%                       |
|Rifle(Old Version)         |~ 5%                         |
|Assault Rifle              |~ 5%                         | 
|Shotgun                    |~ 4%                         |

                    
- The preferred weapons was used by the mass shooter are Semi-Auto Handgun, Semi-Auto Rifle or both of them.
- Light weight, high bullet rate, big magazines. It could help them cause mass casualties in a short period of time.

## Race and Mental Health Issues

```{r Race n Mental , echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}

  mutate(Percentage = 100 * Count/sum(Count))
  
```



## Will The Shooter's Age Be Related over The Course of Time?


```{r General Age Plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
p <- my_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = age_of_shooter, color = gender))

  geom_hline(yintercept = 28) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 38) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, size = 2, color = 'Red')
```


## With Prior Mental Issues

```{r General Age Plot2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
p <- my_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = age_of_shooter, color = gender, shape = prior_signs_mental_health_issues))

  geom_hline(yintercept = 28) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 38) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, size = 2, color = 'Red')
```

## Without Mental Health Issues


```{r General Age Plot3, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
p <- my_data %>%
  filter(!prior_signs_mental_health_issues == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = age_of_shooter, color = gender, shape = prior_signs_mental_health_issues))
p + geom_point() + labs(title = 'Age of The Shooters over Time',
                        x = 'Year',
                        y = 'Age of the Shooters',
                        color ='Gender',
                        shape = 'Prior Signs of Mental Issues') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2002) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 18, size = 2, color = 'Red') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 28) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 38) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, size = 2, color = 'Red')

```

## Compare on Real Numbers

```{r Mental Health}
my_data %>%
  filter(prior_signs_mental_health_issues == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  nrow()
```
If we filter out the cases with the prior mental health issues, there are eighty cases was off the chart, which is almost half cases of mass shooting in the US since 1960.

```{r}
my_data %>% 
  filter(weapons_obtained_legally == "No") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  nrow()
```
In a different case, I cross off the legal weapons obtained, only 16 cases was off the chart, which roughly 10% of all of the cases.


## Conclusion:

Background check on Mental Health Issues is crucial.

## Geography Graph of The Events

```{r Excluded HI n AK, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
my_data_notHInAL <- my_data %>% 
  filter(!state %in% c('HI','AK'))
```


```{r Incidents Map, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(maps)
states_map <- map_data("state") ## this gives us the lat and long for each point of each state.
  
map_plot <-  ggplot(states_map, aes(long, lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group), fill = 'white', color = 'grey60') +
  geom_point(data = my_data_notHInAL, 
             aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, 
                 size = total_victims, color = 'Orange')) +
 coord_map('albers', lat0 = 45.5, lat1 = 29.5) +
  labs(title = 'Geography Location of the Incidents',
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       size = 'Total Victims',
       color = NULL)
  
map_plot
```

The graph shows us an idea that the incidents most likely occurs over the East and West side of the country, and the Mid-west is least likely to happen the mass shootings.


```{r echo=FALSE}
my_data %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(Cases = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Cases)) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = 100 * Cases/sum(Cases))
```
Colorado is the state in top 5 rating of mass shooting even the population rank is not in top 20 nationwide.

Massachusetts surprisingly has no records on mass shooting even the population is in top 16 nationwide.
